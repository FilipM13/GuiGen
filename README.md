# gui_automation

Are you lazy programmer who wants to have GUIs for his apps but does not want to create one for each app individually?
Don't worry so am I. That's why I've spent couple of hours working on automatic GUI generator, instead of creating basic copy-paste GUI in 30 minutes.

The rules are simple:
1. Make one function for each process you want to have.
2. Register this function as `Process` class.
3. Register all instances of `Process` in `App` class instance.
4. Use `app.launch()` and after a little bit of waiting a GUI will pop up!

Is it slow? Perhaps.<br>
Does it work for complex apps? Nope.<br>
Will it fail you once upon a time? Maybe.<br>
Was it "tHorOUgHly TEstEd"? Hell nah. <br>
Is it easy to use? Can it gather all your small scripts in one elegant GUI? Will it save you from going insane while trying to center a div? Very much yes, sir!<br>
